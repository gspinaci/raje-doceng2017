      <h1>Abstract</h1>
      <p>~200 words</p>
      <p>The most used format for submitting and publishing papers in the academic domain is Portable Document Format (PDF), since its possibility of being rendered in the same way independently from the device used for visualising it. However, the PDF format has some important issues as well: it lacks of interactivity, it is not machine-readable, it has seen as a monolithic artefact in the Web, and it is not offering an acceptable accessibility to people with disabilities. In order to address these issues, recently some journals, conferences, and workshops have started to accept also HTML as Web-first submission/publication format. However, most of the people are not able to produce a well-formed HTML5 article from scratch, and they would, thus, need an appropriate interface, e.g. a wordprocessor, for creating such HTML-compliant scholarly article. </p>
      <p> So as to provide a solution to the aforementioned issue, in this paper we introduce the RASH Javascript Editor (a.k.a. RAJE), which is a multiplatform wordprocessor for writing scholarly article in HTML natively. In particular it generates documents compliant with the RASH format, that is a subset of HTML5 developed for sharing scholarly articles with appropriate Web technologies. In particular, RAJE allows authors to write research papers by means of a user-friendly interface hiding the complexities of HTML5. We also discuss the outcomes of an user study where we ask several people from the Academia to write a scientific paper using RAJE.<br /></p>

      <h1>Related works</h1>
      <p>RAJE is a HTML-based wordprocessor, for this reason In the following section we discuss and list all the most important contributors of this area. These descriptions are not heavily detailed, the noted aspects are a simple description and the features of each editor. Every others massively-used wordprocessors are omitted in order to focus the attention only on HTML-based ones.</p>
      <p><strong>Authorea</strong> is an online platform to write and edit scientific papers. Every article is a page, for this reason every paper is a HTML document, plus a paper is a git repository. The first main focus was to <em>fix collaborative problems that could came out during the creation of technical, scholarly and scientific writings</em>, now authors can take advantages of using git versioning system, to keep track of every single displayed change. In fact everyone, which has the right persmissions, can undo specific commit and revert to its previous version. Every article in accessible anywhere, from any device connected to the Internet, and any TeX installations are not required. About tables and formulas it's very advanced. Authorea lets anyone write mathematical notations, tables, plots and fgures in each <em>LaTeX</em> and <em>MathML</em>.</p>
      <p>​​<strong>Dokieli</strong> is a client side editor for decentralised article publishing, annotations and social interactions. Is strongly based on decentralization, authors can publish wherever they want to. Authors can edit any HTML files just importing Dokieli CSS and JavaScripts. In this case Dokieli is not a real WYSIWYG word processor, but instead is more a special module that can turn a browser-rendered paper into a in-browser editable, and annotateable, HTML document.</p>
      <p>It also allows authenticated authors to create in-text annotations and reply to them using the W3C web annotation specifications. It also implements Linked Data Notifications for notifications about entire or part of articles. Now it grants notifications for annotations, replies, shares, reviews, citations/links, bookmarks and likes. A big Dokieli's strenght is its full compatibility with HTML5. All HTML5 elements can be attached and inserted with it, and now some new UI features to do that are under development. For that reason the entire view style can be customized with just some CSS lines, or if needed style can be changed directly with Dokieli (e.g. passing fromnative visualization to Springer LNCS view).</p>
      <p><strong>Fidus Writer</strong> is an open source WYSIWYG collaborative HTML-based word processor made for academics who need to use citations and formulas within papers. All articles can be exported in more ways: website, paper or ebook. In each case the focus is the content, layouts can be choose during publication. FidusWriter supports LaTeX for adding footnotes and citations directly inside the documents. It is also collaborative in real-time, which means that FidusWriter aims to fix sharing problems for many-authors papers, and everyone can automatically see and write the document in the same time.Its formula system works hand by hand with MathJax, MathType and LaTeX.</p>
      <p><strong>TinyMCE</strong> is more an Open Source library than a stand-alone editor. It can integrate a WYSIWYG HTML-based editor inside a website. Is a large project that involve 130 contributors with almost 5000 commits on Github. Among its features there are formatting, table insertion, image editing, customizable themes and it is accesible for users with disabilities because it follows WAI-ARIA specification making it compatible with screen readers such as JAWS and NVDA. <br /></p>
      <p>Another strenght is that TinyMCE can be integrated everywhere. Can be found from CDN and package managers (NPM, Bower,NuGet), and integrated with frameworks such as JQuery and Angular.js, or inside common CMS like Wordpress or Joomla. Its community and contributors ar lively on networks, issues and enhancements are fastly fixed.<br /></p>

      <h1>RAJE</h1>
      <p>The HTML-oriented wordprocessor we propose is used to generate research articles in RASH format (i.e. Research Articles in Simplified HTML). RASH is a Web-first format for writing HTML-based scholarly papers. One of the first differences beetwen RASH and the other similar proposals, is that it has reduced HTML elements to a minimum of only 32 (in order to reduce cognitive cost to authors and avoid the <em>ambiguities</em> normally permitted by HTML itself). Also, RASH has been designed to be easy to learn and use, and it works well with sharing scholarly documents (and embedding semantic annotations) through the web. For the same reason more articles can be semantically linked each other, with interactive behaviours granted by JavaScript and web browsers.</p>
      <p>RASH comes with its own framework, i.e. the RASH framework. It is a set of specifications and <em>writing/conversion/extraction</em> tools for writing articles with this format. RASH documents can be easily validated using the HTML5 validator (<a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/">W3C Nu HTML Checker</a>), to be advised about potential semantic issues. Visualisation is also a framework's duty. Browsers can natively display any RASH documents (in the same way they render common HTML documents) thanks to the wrapped CSS stylesheets and JavaScript libraries. The integrated CSS styles can be used from authors if he/she wants to pass from native HTML viualisation to a LaTeX-style layout (ACM, Springer LNCS and so on). </p>
      <section id="section10">
        <h1>General overview</h1>
        <p>RAJE is a stand-alone multi-platform software used to generate RASH document. Normally a new document is saved locally, but every new changes can be also stored online, where any other authors can contribute with.</p>
        <p>In the following section we discuss about the tool's stregths and the reasons why we created RAJE. It is created because of the need of a wordprocessor-like interface to edit a RASH document, furthermore it has a centralised place accessible to everyone where to store documents, i.e. Github. During the development period we defined other needs, related to the document accessibility, a math formulas editor with asciiMath as input, which generates rendered formulas thanks to the MathJax process. Further we discuss the integration beetwen RAJE and Github and how we managed its functionalities.</p>
        <section id="section14">
          <h1>Header</h1>
          <p>The metadata of a RASH document are stored inside the <code>​head</code>​ element in the form of <code>meta</code>​ or <code>​link</code>​. With browsers are rendered as shown in figure <a href="#figure_1">Figure 1</a>. The header of a RASH file is made up with more elements, needed to contextualize the entire article <a href="#bib1"> </a>. Title and authors list are obviously very important for what concern documents of scientific mold, and in this case also keywords and ACM subject categories. Thanks to RASH we can have articles written by many authors. For this reason RAJE permits to insert, change, and delete authors. Among the other things is reasonable wanting to change the author's order, triggering the corrispondent action from software menu and repositioning them with Drag &amp; Drop tecnology.</p>
          <figure id="figure_1">
            <p><img src="img/header.png" alt="img/header.png" /></p>
            <figcaption>Header of a rendered RASH document.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Because of the complex and importance of the metadata structure, we chose to restrict the editing permissions. Every element can be easily single-edited by clicking it. We choose to use the "single-click action" because it is the expression of the willingness to interact with a graphic element. </p>
          <p>Any <em>author</em> has its own button set for adding a new author before or removing the selected one. According to the RASH documentation, authors can have more <em>affiliations</em>. Any new affiliation can be added pressing <code>​enter</code>​ key. This action will add a placeholder that can be remove pressing <code>enter</code> again as shown in <a href="#figure_2">Figure 2</a>.</p>
          <figure id="figure_2">
            <p><img src="img/author.png" alt="img/author.png" /></p>
            <figcaption>​Adding new affiliation.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p><em>Categories</em> and <em>keywords</em> can be also edited after click event, the only one difference is behaviour. It is same as the <code>inline code</code> elements: space button inserts a space inside the element, instead the enter key inserts a space after the element indicating its end. </p>
          <p>The <em>title</em> is usually accompanied with a <em>subtitle</em>. If during title editing an author wants to insert the subtitle can simply press <code>​enter</code>​ at the end. The subtitle is now added, and can be filled up with text, or the author can proceed to the next editable element pressing <code>enter</code> again.​​ We think that is more easy and banal pressing this button to exit from the current element and go to the next one. At leas the editing way of the header is different from body, it has a lesser degree of restriction.</p>

          <h1>MathJax and MathML</h1>
          <p>With the version 0.6 of RASH, formulas can be also written in asciiMath and rendered with the MathJax processor (formulas are still saved in mathML). This update lead us to create a easy-to-use environment in which users write down formulas using only asciiMath as input. AsciiMath basically is easier to learn, write and remember than LaTeX and mathML are.   </p>
          <p>MathJax comes in authors aid when RAJE wants to process the asciiMath input. In real time the processor convert the input in mathML. This help very much, in particular for those not familiar with the syntax necessary to add symbols or functions. Although simpler than latex, asciiMath can still be difficult, and authors can always use the buttons immediatly under the input textbox in order to add preset of instructions (such as function, limit, square root and so on). All the arrangement of the elements was designed crossing the asciiMath syntax and the OpenOffice editor layout.</p>

          <h1>Marriage with github</h1>
          <p>As already mentioned before, RAJE is strictly wired to a kind of "cloud-like" system in such a way to easy up the communication and sharing of articles beetwen its stakeholders. Because HTML is not only raw, text it works perfectly in tune with Git (precisely in this case Github interface). The main idea is that<br /><strong>"a single article is a repository"</strong> with all the privileges it bring with him. </p>
          <p>At the first time that an author push the article, Github create a new repository filled with code and assets. It can be found at <code>https://github.com/{author_username}/{repository_name}​</code>​. ​Pushing the article you can create a new folder to the choosen path, that will be immediatly filled with code and assets of the article corrispondent to the typed URL. To all effect is the samethings to open a document previously created, with the only difference that this time we are talking about the  repository. </p>
          <p>During the editing phase if a user wants to store online the content of a document, he must be first logged in with its own Github account, which certifies its identity. Omitting the authentication mode, o better the development of the predisposed module for handling authentication, the user has the option to save the document online, on Github servers. This action can be executed in two ways: the shortcut <code>ctrl+shift+s</code> (<code>cmd+shift+s</code> if OSX) or the button "push" under the dropdown with author's Github profile avatar. Will be viewed a simple modal that permits the user to label up the entire sets of changes under an unique comment, a commit. When the upload is done will be shown a success message, in a non invasively way, on the screen, indicating the success. </p>
          <p>The mangement of sharing documents needs that all repository contributors are always updated to the latest article version, to avoid merge conflicts. In the RAJE current version this functionality has not been introduced yet, but is a crucial fact of distributed system management, will be implemented soon.</p>

        <h1>Technical overview</h1>
        <p>In this chapter I introduce tell the technologies and the development process i have adopted to create RAJE.The editor is multiplatform, but it has been created as unique project, with the libraries made available from Electron,Also Known As Atom shell.In this chapter I will describe what Eletron is, and how I used the File System's API to create this software. Next I will introduce the beating heart of RAJE, the script raje.js that I personally built with the aid of JQuery and some other modules, like @TimDown's rangy used to abstract the selection elements and Mousetrap to simplify the manage of shortcuts. Finally, regarding Electron, I will explain how I have made different deploys for the different Operating Systems supported by RAJE: OSX, Windows and Linux.<br /></p>
