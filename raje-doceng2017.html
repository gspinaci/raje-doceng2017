      <h1>Abstract</h1>
      <p>The most used format for submitting and publishing papers in the academic domain is Portable Document Format (PDF), since its possibility of being rendered in the same way independently from the device used for visualising it. However, the PDF format has some important issues as well: it lacks of interactivity, it is not machine-readable, it has seen as a monolithic artefact in the Web, and it is not offering an acceptable accessibility to people with disabilities. In order to address these issues, recently some journals, conferences, and workshops have started to accept also HTML as Web-first submission/publication format. However, most of the people are not able to produce a well-formed HTML5 article from scratch, and they would, thus, need an appropriate interface, e.g. a wordprocessor, for creating such HTML-compliant scholarly article. </p>
      <p> So as to provide a solution to the aforementioned issue, in this paper we introduce the RASH Javascript Editor (a.k.a. RAJE), which is a multiplatform wordprocessor for writing scholarly article in HTML natively. In particular it generates documents compliant with the RASH format, that is a subset of HTML5 developed for sharing scholarly articles with appropriate Web technologies. In particular, RAJE allows authors to write research papers by means of a user-friendly interface hiding the complexities of HTML5. We also discuss the outcomes of an user study where we ask several people from the Academia to write a scientific paper using RAJE.<br /></p>

    <section id="section1">
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Currently the most used format for submitting and publishing academic research articles is the Portable Document Format (PDF) <a href="#bib12"> </a>. One of the main strengths if this format is its hard formatting style that ensures to be read and visualised by any device in the same way. However, PDF has also important drawbacks, such as the lack of interactivity, the fact that its monolithic structure is not appropriate for sharing its content on the Web as a common webpage, and its known difficulties regarding the accessiblity of its content by people with disabilities <a href="#bib13"> </a>. In order to create an article, authors need to create a document that will be exported as PDF. These documents are usually written with word processor (e.g. Microsoft Word and OpenOffice) or by means of appropriate markup languages such as LaTeX. While in the first case the rendering of the page (and, thus, of the final PDF to export) is what the wordprocessor show in the screen, LaTeX obliges its user to compile the document in order to understand how it will be rendered in PDF.</p>
      <p>In the last years, the use of PDF as submission/publication format has been criticised by several people and movements (e.g. <a href="https://linkedresearch.org/">Linked Research</a>), and several discussion has raised the issue of using another (Web-first, accessible, and open) format for perparing and sharing scholarly works, i.e. HTML <a href="#bib6"> </a>. Following this idea, several conferences and journals have started to experiment the use of HTML as submission format. For instance the <a href="http://iswc2016.semanticweb.org/">15th</a> and the <a href="http://iswc2016.semanticweb.org/">16th International Semantic Web Conferece</a>, the <a href="2016.eswc-conferences.org">13th</a> and the <a href="2016.eswc-conferences.org">14th Extended Semantic Web Conference</a>, the <a href="http://ekaw2016.cs.unibo.it">20th International Conference on Knowledge Management and Knowledge Engineering</a>, the Poster and Demo session at <a href="https://2017.semantics.cc">13th International Conference on Semantic Systems</a>, and journals like <a href="http://datasciencehub.net/">Data Science</a> published by IOS Press, are among those that have started to adopt HTML.</p>
      <p>One of the most used and appreciated<a href="#fn4"> </a> formats for creating HTML-based scholarly papers is <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash">Research Articles in Simplified HTML (RASH)</a> <a href="#bib1"> </a>. RASH is a markup language that restricts the use of HTML elements to only 32 elements, and enables one to include also RDF statements <a href="#bib15"> </a>. In addition, it uses the the new Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0 <a href="#bib14"> </a> for specifying accessible structural semantics to the various document parts. While the framework that has beed developed for RASH includes a lot of conversion tools from wordprocessor formats (e.g. the Open Document Format used by Open Office and the Open XML format used by Microsfot Word), no native editor for facilitating the creation of Web-first RASH article has been proposed yet.</p>
      <p>In this paper we introduce the <strong style="font-size: 12pt;">RASH Javascript Editor</strong> (RAJE), a <em>What You See Is What You Get</em> (WYSIWYG) wordprocessor for writing scholarly articles in HTML by means of the RASH format. In particular RAJE allows authors to write research papers in HTML natively by means of a user-friendly interface, instead of writing raw markup with a IDE, text editors or external wordprocessors. It guarantees users the benefits of a wordprocessor combined with the ones given by a HTML-based format which are interactiveness, accessibility and easiness to be processed by machine. In addition, RAJE uses the GitHub API so as to allow authors to store their articles online, to keep track of changes by means of the GitHub services, and to share the articles with others. This paper has been written by using RAJE itself, and converted into the appropriate layout requested by the conference by means of the <a href="http://dasplab.cs.unibo.it/rocs">RASH Online Conversion Service (ROCS</a><a href="http://dasplab.cs.unibo.it/rocs">)</a> <a href="#bib16"> </a>.</p>
      <p>The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In <a href="#section2"> </a> we describe some of the most important HTML-based editors. In <a href="#section3"> </a> we introduce RAJE, and we provide high level principles and low level details. In <a href="#section4">Section 4</a> we present the outcomes of a user testing session we have run by involving people in the Academia so as to understand the level of preceived usability of RAJE when used for writing a scholarly article. Finally, in <a href="#section9">Section 5</a> we conclude the paper sketching out some future developments.<br /></p>

      <h1>Related works</h1>
      <p>In the past several works have been developed for allowing an easy creation of HTML-based scholarly papers. In this section we introduce some of the most relevant ones, by discussing their main characteristics.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.authorea.com/">Authorea</a></strong> is an online platform to write and edit scientific papers. Every article is an HTML document and Git repository simultaneously. The main goal for the development of Authorea was to <a href="http://www.astrobetter.com/blog/2015/07/13/why-should-i-use-authorea-to-write-my-papers/">fix collaborative problems that could came out during the creation of technical, scholarly and scientific writings</a>, so as to allow authors to take advantages of using Git versioning system and keeping track of every single displayed change. In addition, every article in accessible from anywhere, by using any device connected to the Internet, and no TeX installation is required for producing the final PDF layout necessary for the submission.In addition, Authorea allows one to write <a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/3/articles/6055-how-is-authorea-different-from-google-docs/">mathematical notations, tables, plots and figures in each LaTeX and MathML</a>.</p>
      <p>​​<strong><a href="http://dokie.li/">Dokieli</a></strong> <a href="#bib17"> </a> is a client side editor for decentralised article publishing, annotations and social interactions. Since dokieli follows a pure decentralization principle, authors can publish the paper where they prefer. In particular, dokieli complies with the <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">Solid protocol</a>, based on the Linked Data Platform W3C standard <a href="#bib18"> </a> <a href="#bib19"> </a>, so as to allows one to edit the HTML-based scholarly article in the browser and to save it directly to server storage.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.fiduswriter.org/">Fidus Writer</a></strong> is an open source WYSIWYG collaborative HTML-based word processor made for academics who need to use citations and formulas within papers. All the articles created with it can be exported in more ways: as a website, a paper, or an ebook. Independently from the particular export, the editor allows authors to focus on the content of the paper, while the final layout can be choose once the content is finalised. FidusWriter supports LaTeX for adding footnotes and citations directly inside the documents, and allows a real-time collaboratiion with other users.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.tinymce.com/">TinyMCE</a></strong> is a WYSIWYG HTML-based editor that can be instantiated within an existing HTML page. It is a huge project that involves more than 150 contributors with almost 6500 commits on <a href="https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce">Github</a>. Its include facilities for formatting, table insertion, image editing, customizable themes, and it is accesible for users with disabilities – in fact it follows WAI-ARIA guidelines <a href="#bib20"> </a> so as to make HTML documents compatible with screen readers such as JAWS and NVDA. It is already integrated with frameworks such as JQuery and Angular.js, or inside common content management systems such as Wordpress or Joomla.</p>

      <h1>The RASH Javascript Editor</h1>
      <p>In this section we provide a brief introduction about RASH and its Framework, and then we discuss the RASH Javascript Editor (RAJE) by preseting its features and by discussing some details about its implementation.</p>
      <section id="section25">
        <h1>The RASH Framework</h1>
        <p>The Research Articles in Simplified HTML (RASH) format is a markup language that restricts the use of HTML elements to only 32 elements for writing academic research articles. It allows authors to add RDF statements <a href="#bib15"> </a> to the document by means of the element <code>script</code> with the attribute type set to <q style="font-size: 12pt;">application/rdf+xml</q>, <q style="font-size: 12pt;">text/turtle</q> or to <q style="font-size: 12pt;">application/ld+json</q>. In addition, RASH strictly follows the Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0 <a href="#bib14"> </a> for expressing structural semantics on various markup elements used. </p>
        <p>A RASH document begins as a simple (X)HTML5 document, by specifying the generic HTML DOCTYPE followed by the document element <code>html</code> with the usual namespace <q>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</q> specified. The element <code>html</code> contains the element <code>head</code> for defining metadata of the document according to the DCTERMS and PRISM standards, and the element <code>body</code> for including the whole content of the document. On the one hand, the element <code>head</code> of a RASH document must/should include some information about the paper, i.e., the paper title (element <code>title</code>), at least one author and other related information (i.e., affiliations, keywords, categories, by using the elements <code>meta</code> and <code>link</code>). On the other hand, the element <code>body</code> mainly contains textual elements (e.g., paragraphs, emphases, links, and quotations) for describing the content of the paper, and other structural elements (e.g., abstract, sections, references, and footnotes) used to organised the paper in appropriate blocks and to present specific complex structures (e.g., figures, formulas, and tables).</p>
        <p>RASH is accompanied by its <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash">Framework</a>, which is a set of specifications and writing/conversion/extraction tools for writing articles in RASH. In particular the RASH Framework includes tools for checking the validity of RASH documents, visualising RASH documents on browsers with different layouts, for converting RASH documents into LaTeX and ODT/DOCX files into RASH, and for automatically annotate RASH elements with their actual (structural) semantics according to the <a href="http://purl.org/spar/doco">Document Components Ontology (DoCO)</a> <a href="#bib21"> </a>.</p>

        <h1>RAJE: high-level overview</h1>
        <p>RAJE is a stand-alone multi-platform software used to generate RASH document. Its <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/tree/master/sources/raje">sources</a> and the related <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/tree/master/tools/RAJE">binary files</a> are available on GitHub a licensed according to the <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/blob/master/LICENSE">ISC License</a>, as all the other tools included in the RASH Framework. Before starting the development of the tools we have decided a series of desiderata and needs that such an editor should properly address, as introduced in the following list:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>being totally-compatible with RASH and HTML5; </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>relying on the existing tools developed for visualising RASH documents, included in the RASH Framework;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>simplifying the writing of the document keeping things as natural as possible if one has to edit the document by means of her favourite wordprocessor;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>not enabling the user to personalise the actual rendering of it according to specific layouts – the focus is on the content only;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>following the best practices already used by existing wordprocessors such as Microsoft Word and Open Office for creating structures typical of scholarly articles (lists, tables, figures, references, etc.);</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>allowing the creation of mathematical formulas by means of an appropriate interface, hiding the complexities of the language used for storing such formulas with Web-first formats, e.g. MathML;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>interacting with GitHub for easing the storing, sharing, and preservation of the articles.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the following subsections we provide a brief discussion about how the typical structures of a scholarly article can be created by means of RAJE.</p>
        <section id="section14">
          <h1>Article metadata</h1>
          <p>The metadata of a RASH document are stored inside the <code>​head</code>​ element in the form of <code>meta</code>​ or <code>​link</code>​. These metadata are rendered by the browser as shown in <a href="#figure_1">Figure 1</a> and include: the title (mandatory), the author list (mandatory), the ACM subject categories (optional), and the keywords (optional). RAJE permits to act on any of these metadata.</p>
          <figure id="figure_1">
            <p><img src="img/header.png" alt="img/header.png" /></p>
            <figcaption>Header of a rendered RASH document.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Every element in this metadata section can be easily single-edited by clicking it, and the cursor will be placed where requested. </p>
          <p>The title is usually accompanied with a subtitle. To insert the subtitle, one can simply press ​<code>enter</code>​ at the end of the title. Once added, the subtitle can be filled up with text, and the author can proceed to the next editable element pressing <code>enter</code> again.​​<br /></p>
          <p>Any author listed has its own button set for adding a new author after it or for removing the selected one. It is possible to specify more affiliation for the same author by pressing pressing the <code>​enter</code>​ key once the cursor is placed in the affiliation area, just after the author's name. This action will add a new placeholder that can be editer by typing new text or removed by pressing <code>enter</code> again as shown in <a href="#figure_2">Figure 2</a>.</p>
          <figure id="figure_2">
            <p><img src="img/author.png" alt="img/author.png" /></p>
            <figcaption>​Adding new affiliation.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p><em>Categories</em> and <em>keywords</em> can be also edited by clicking on the specific section, and pressing the <code>enter</code> key allows one to add additional keyword/categories.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="section15">
          <h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>
          <p>From the version 0.6, RASH has started to support the use of different languages for writing mathematical expressions, which include MathML, LaTeX and <a href="http://asciimath.org/">AsciiMath</a>. All these formulas are actually rendered by means of the <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax processor</a>, while they will be stored in MathML in the final RASH source. This flexibility of using several formats allowed us to create an intuitive and easy-to-use environment in RAJE in which users write down formulas using only AsciiMath as input – since, from preliminary tests we run, AsciiMath seemed to be the language easier to learn, write and remember.   </p>
          <p>However, even if AsciiMath is the easier language for mathematical formulas that can be adopted in the contest of RASH documents, it could be difficult anyway to remember all the kinds of operation it allows one to specify. In order to address this issue, RAJE also includes several buttons (labelled <q>Operations</q>, <q>Misc</q>, <q>Relations</q>, <q>Symbols</q>, and <q>Formulas</q>, as shown in <a href="#figure_3"> </a>) that allow one to select an operation among a list of preset instructions. The way all these buttons are presented to the user has been guided by considering the OpenOffice formula editor.</p>
          <figure id="figure_3">

        </section>
        <section id="section16">
          <h1>Storing the article online with GitHub</h1>
          <p>Since we wanted to have a system that allows to store and share the article on the Web, we implemented a module that allows authors to push the article on a GitHub repository by means of the GiyHub API. GitHub is a web-based version control repository that offers all of the distributed version control and source code management features of Git, and enables access control and several collaboration facilities (e.g. bug tracking, feature requests, task management). In this context, any article created by RAJE can be seen as a repository on GitHub.</p>
          <p>The first time an author pushes the article on GitHub, a new repository is created with all the code (i.e. the main text content in HTML) and assets (CSSs, Javascript files, etc.) needed for guaranteeing a correct visualisation of the article. The repository URL is created according to the schema <code>https://github.com/{author_username}/{repository_name}​</code>​, where <code>{author_username}</code> is replaced with the author's GitHub username, while the <code>{repository_name}</code> is the title of the article.</p>
          <p>During the editing phase, if a user wants to store online the content of a document, he must be first logged in with its own Github account, which certifies its identity. Then user has the option to save the document online, on Github servers. This action can be executed in two ways: the shortcut <code>ctrl+shift+s</code> (<code>cmd+shift+s</code> if OSX) or the button "push" under the dropdown with author's Github profile avatar on the top-right of the RAJE interface. A success message is shown once the commit finished successfully.</p>

        <h1>Technical overview -- TODO: Silvio</h1>
        <p>In this setion we discuss the used technologies and the adopted development process, in order to build up the tool. RAJE is based on <a href="https://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a> (a.k.a. Atom Shell) which allows developers to generate multi-platform softwares using only web-based technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Next other integrated modules and script are described, such as <a href="https://github.com/timdown/rangy">Tim Down's rangy</a>.</p>
        <section id="section18">
          <h1>Electron and APIs</h1>
          <p>Electron is a Open Source framework created by Github developers, based on the already famous node.js API. It is avery lively project, it count near 13.000 commits divided beetwen the 500 total contributors.Electron is pratically a browser wrapper. It utilize Chromium as browser to create multi platform softwares. </p>
          <p>Thanks to this framework is guaranteed the development with web-technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.Two are the important processes in any Electron-based software: The Main process and the Renderer process.The <strong>Main process</strong> is a node.js script, that includes every kind of necessary information and setting to guarantee the smooth progress of the software, e.g. it creates and shows the <em>windows</em>, uses <em>node.js modules</em> and can acces to <em>databases</em>.Instead the <strong>Renderer process</strong> is a script imported directly in the document with the classical syntax <script src="rendered.js"></script>​. It allows RAJE to utilize NPM packages (the manager of node.js modules) and can communicate in an Async or Sync way with the main process to exchange messages.</p>
          <section id="section21">
            <h1>File System APIs</h1>
            <p>RAJE is a software Because of the <strong>FS api</strong>. If it was only a JavaScript file, like <em>rash.js</em>, cannot be possible locally save articles. Only few browsers allows scripts to access the FS and write files and directory <a href="#bib2">[2]</a>.</p>
          </section>
          <p>The File System APIs are required, expecially for a software that can execute CRUD operations on files, indeed. The <strong>fs library</strong> is one of the most important library, because it is placed among default node.js modules, it contains some very useful methods such as <em>readDir</em> (get a the list of files contained in a directory), <em>writeFile</em> (write a file with the given content)​ and <em>readFile</em> (get the content of the selected file) which are asynchronous. RAJE sometimes uses also them sync counterpart (e.g. <em>readFileSync</em>).</p>
          <p>When an author wants to generate a new article, RAJE creates its directory and move inside the whole required assets bundle (which are CSS stylesheets and JavaScript scripts) using few FS functions. </p>

          <p>The APIs to communicate with Github are implemented using a wrapper: <a href="https://github.com/pksunkara/octonode">Octonode</a>, which grants a lot of actions on contents, users and repositories. Octonode is built on the Github API v3, and it provides also OAuth2 login. With few code lines is possible to integrate an Electron project with the module which provides connection with the protocol OAuth2. To set up a project and arrange to have login, first of all is necessary that the developer application is already created and be in possession of the two necessary codes: client ID and secret ID.As soon the application is created, it is now possible to use some code lines to authenticate users with the protocol OAuth2. </p>
          <p>The Octonode library also serves a different method to authenticate with Github. In RAJE the authentication is implemented as follows. All needed functions are stored inside a variable, created when an author pushes the right button to be logged in, at this moment also the <code>client_token</code> is generated.​ In order to obtain the <code>client_token</code>​ the author need to authorize RAJE to access its personal information as shown in <a href="#figure_4">Figure 4</a>. This window will describe what kind of permissions RAJE needs, it can read all public information about the user (such as email, name, biography and so on) and about public repositories (the ones which are importantfor RAJE).</p>

            <p><img src="img/authorize.png" alt="img/authorize.png" /></p>
            <figcaption>Authorize application modal.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Once authorizations are given by the use, a message is sent to Github servers, and a result comes back in return. Normally Github needs an URL callback, so the token can be directly sent there, where it will be elaborated. RAJE, instead, as a browser can handle the navigation events. It can listen for the callback and extract the result code from URL. Then RAJE execute a POST request, to get the <code>access_token</code>, with the function in <a href="#table_1">Listing 1</a>. </p>
          <figure id="table_1">
            <pre>​function requestGithubToken(githubOptions, code) {apiRequests.post('https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token', {client_id: githubOptions.client_id,client_secret: githubOptions.client_secret,code: code,}).end(function (err, response) {if (response &amp;&amp; response.ok) {/** Save github token to settings */storage.setGithubSettings({ 'token': response.body.access_token }, (err) =&gt; {if (err) throw errgetUserInfo()})} else {// Error - Show messages.console.log(err)}})
}<code><br /></code></pre>
            <figcaption>Function to request the <code>access_token</code>.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The method in <a href="#table_1">Listing 1</a> uses a node.js module called <em>superagent</em>, an high level wrapper for ajax requests. With it module RAJE can make a POST request, passing all needed informations in order to retrieve the token. In this snippet the token is saved with the <code>electron_storage</code>​ module, i.e. a simple environment JSON storage for the current machine. </p>
          <p>The login workflow is the following: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>The author express the will to be logged in, pressing the login button (placed in the right-top corner).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>RAJE shows the authorization modal. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The author eccept authorization requirements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Github send the URL callback containing the code.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>RAJE extract the code and request the token.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Github send the token in return.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>RAJE stores the token for next requests.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

When the token is stored, every future requests (such as create a repository or push a commit) are instantly served because everything is saved inside the variable client​.           <p>When a new article is opened, a local folder is created with the document and all the needed assets, and when authors want to PUSH changes to a non existent repository, it is created. Every time a PUSH is requested the SHA and the content of file to update are required but if no repositories are founded, also in this case RAJE needs to create it. </p>
          <p>Inside the <code>client</code> variable we can find the method <code>.me()​</code> which returns an instance of the logged user. Object <code>me</code> has inside all allowed operations to users, and among them, the creation of a new repository. With the method <code>client.me().repo({},callback)​</code> in our aid, a new repository is created, the first parameter is an object that contains properties like name, description and other less importantinformation.</p>
          <p>Once the repository is created we need to push also the assets, which are Javascript scripts, CSS style files and fonts​ (required by FontAwesome). The current versione of RAJE needs to synchronize these files one after another (synchronous paradigm). Those two are the most important examples of integration with the big API of Github, but they give us the proof of what it can be possible to do.</p>

          <h1>Web based technology</h1>
          <p>As already mentioned in the previous sections, RAJE in built on Electron, which uses web technologies as Javascript and CSS to give at client-side behaviours and styles. The <strong>splash window</strong><a href="#fn2"> </a> is simply a html file with its own Javascript and CSS, rendered by the Main process. Instead the editor itself is the HTML file stored inside the article folder. When it is visualised by a browser (Chromium in our case) it has <em>rash.js</em> script that turn the document into RASH-rendered form. In the same way adding <em>raje.js</em> a RASH document can be turned into a editable document with toolbar and other useful elements. </p>
          <p>For this reason, the core of this editor is not the software itself, but insted is the imported script. Software gives some important wiring behaviors (FS and Github APIs). The <em>editor behaviour</em> is inside the document (stored as a script), but if someone try to open the file with a normal browser, he can view only a normal RASH file, because the editor will be shown and added only if the document is opened with RAJE. In other words, this is very useful to send read-only documents or show it with rawgit.</p>
          <section id="section23">
            <h1>Editor's core: raje.js</h1>
          </section>
          <p>All the RAJE project flow around the raje.js script. It is built concatenating more scripts (each with its own behaviour and purpose). They are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>init.js</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>caret.js</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>const.js</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>raje.js</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>shortcuts.js</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>toolbar.js</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>derash.js</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>rendered.js<br /></p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Init.js</strong> is the initialization script, it initializes the variables (like bodyContent<a href="#fn3"> </a> or edit_state), extends JQuery object adding more new functions, handle the creation of figures and call the<code> $(document).ready()</code> function to set up the whole editor. Two important functions added to the JQuery object are: <strong>setEditable()</strong> and <strong>setNotEditable()</strong>, both act on the document editability. </p>
          <p>Very important is what happen to the sections: them are detached from the body and after attached to a new container, i.e. the section with contenteditable attribute sets to true (it is added right below the header).</p>
          <p>The second script, that is <strong>caret.js</strong>. It provides some utility methods about the caret and its position. It contains functions to check if the caret is inside some elements e.g. if is inside the editor, header or an heading (<code>h1</code>,<code>h2</code> and so on), or to create a selection that wraps entirely the node where the caret is. All the methods here are based on rangy. </p>
          <p>Some constants to store numbers and string called multiple times are wrapped inside the <strong>const.js</strong> script, in order to aware of <em>magic numbers anti-pattern</em>.</p>
          <p>Then there is <strong>raje.js</strong>, a set of actions to add elements directly onto the body. More of them uses the <em>contenteditable APIs</em> (e.g. to add undo/redo) or the method <code>document.execCommand('insertHTML')​</code> that add a HTML string to the caret. All figure elements and cross-references are intended as objects, a new element is a new object​. There are also methods to add sections of any kind, from normal ones to specials.</p>
          <p>All shortcuts are stored in <strong>shortcuts.js</strong> script. All of them are binded inside an init function called when the document is ready. The shortcuts are all implemented using the <em>Mousetrap module</em>, and needed to trigger a different behaviour from the normal one. Over that the enter key press event, may triggers different behaviour based on where the caret is.</p>
          <p>The entire graphic elements set is inside<strong> toolbar.js</strong>. Here there are variables which contain HTML strings that need to be added after. Among them there is the toolbar and all other modals, each with its own method to show it.</p>
          <p>A rendered document is different from the stored one, and rash.js deals with the only transformation from the stored to the rendered article. RAJE need a kind of mechanism to do the specular thing, in otherwords the script <strong>derash.js</strong>. This comes in aid when we save the article, it creates and beautify the HTML string that is the file. When it creates the string, is completely minified for this reason inside this script there is a function which its objective is to mantain the multi line property and tabulation. </p>
          <p>At least <strong style="font-size: 12pt;">rendered.js</strong> contains everything to handle communication from and to the Main process, such as: Github login, save document locally, push updates etc.</p>

        <section id="section20">
          <h1>Modules</h1>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/timdown/">@TimDown</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/timdown/rangy/">rangy</a> is very popular, and it has also a active community leaded by his founder Tim Down. On StackOverflow most of questions about contenteditable and selection management has a rangy-based answer. Every browser implements a naïve selection interface, and for a wider spectrum of methods, we adopted rangy because it grants a lot of useful operations. In a particular way, it works great to know where the caret is, or its position inside the parent. It can also allow to move the caret to start or the end of an element (this behaviour is saved inside <strong>caret.js</strong>). </p>
          <p>Otherwise the submodule rangy-selectionsaverestore can save the current caret position to restore after. E.g. when the user wants to add an image inside the article, after clicking the button, a modal is shown. Here is where the editor needs to save the current selection, because next he probably change the focus to a button, a textbox or directly with a single click in anywhere else position and loose the previous reference where to insert the element. When he chose file and it is saved, RAJE restore the selection to move the caret where it was before, then it add the new element. </p>
          <p>The other subpackage is rangy-textrange, and can allows to move the caret ahead or behind of some position (tipically characters). This behaviour is used to exit from inline elements. Inside code elements the spaces are allowed, instead if the author press enter he will exit from it (and the caret will be moved one character ahead).</p>
          <p>All the shortcuts are attached directly to the <code>section#rashEditor​</code>, because it have the mousetrap class, which is the one recognised by <a href="https://craig.is/killing/mice">Mousetrap</a>. This script is really easy yo use, is only about to connect somehow a character or a sequence of them. Everythig is referred to a Mousetrap class, and only the function bind is called. The signature means that it accepts a string (that is the sequence to trigger the event) and a callback called when the event is triggered. Mousetrap is used to bind <code>ctrl+b</code> or <code>cmd+b</code> (the plus indicates that the two buttons need to be pressed at the same time) to handle the bold behaviour.</p>

      <h1>Evaluation</h1>
      <p>Now, after the description of what RAJE is and how it is implemented, the last step is about <strong>testing the software to highlight critical issues and its level of usability</strong>. The test survey is made with <a href="http://eSurv.org">eSurv.org</a>, findable <a href="https://eSurv.org?u=rajetest">here</a>. This test is a <strong>DUT</strong>, i.e. Discount Usability Test. These kind of tests are made involving only few people: it is possible to find up to 80% of the main bugs involving only 3 or 5 people <a href="#bib5">[5]</a><a href="#bib4"> </a>. In this section, we present the evaluation of RAJE based on the analysis of the survey's results.</p>
      <section id="section7">
        <h1>Settings</h1>
        <p>There were two prerequisites that needed to be satisfied: the RAJE executable must be downloaded and unzipped by testers, and they need a Github account. The testers were required to fill a form organised with the preliminary answers about name, affiliation and reseach area and some assertion categorised as expertise with: <br /></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Formats (e.g. DOC(X), ODT...)<br /></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Word processors and HTML-based editors <br /></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Research articles writing <br /></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Control version systems</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p> In total were 17 assertion, with the following format: "I am expert in HTML documents", each needed to be answered with one of the following: Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree and Strongly Disagree. With this answers is possible to create profiles anonymous of the testers' background, which are used before to generate the results with the SUS answers. </p>
        <p>In order to capture the usability, <strong>the first task</strong> was to write <a href="asdf">this PDF article</a> using RAJE. To obtain this document we followed the normal RASH workflow. We created the test document using RAJE, and we used ROCS to convert the output document in LaTeX with the Springer LNCS style. The TeX document was then compiled in PDF. Inside the document there is the whole set of elements and actions that a user can execute. In the abstract section there are some few text elements and a list. In the next sections there are tables, figures, listings and formulas, it also contains footnotes and bibliographic references.</p>
        <p><strong>The second task</strong> aimed to evaluate the integration beetwen RAJE and Github, commiting and pushing the repository. To complete this task testers are needed to be logged in with their Github account. Then they have to push the created document, with a initial comment. When the article is saved online as a repository, testers have to navigate to the RawGit link and save it inside the document. After that the output folder must be compressed into a archive and send to my email, in order to evaluate the HTML given in output.</p>
        <p>The last pages contains two final questionnaires about testers' experience and feedback, with the aim of collecting enough informations to pursuit their elaboration.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="section8">
        <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>The initiative had a substantial success: RAJE received 6 complete feedback about the usage of its prototype. These feedback were submitted by 6 testers from Canada, Sweden, Germany, Italy and England. These result are very useful to catch real feedback from people which have particular interest in this research area.</p>
        <p>We also performed a quantitative analysis of the usability of RAJE, using the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire. The scores are acceptable, though not very high, especially if we consider that all testers was pushed to use a complete new tool, <em>without any kind of introductive tutorial before</em>. RASH yielded a mean score of 60 points, slightly lower than the average SUS score (68). </p>

First of all most of RAJE's lacks are inside the macro category "text editor functionalities". It means that some minor (but important) bugs were faced by testers, and in some cases those bugs denied the normal flow of tool. Basical keyboard shortcuts such as <strong>ctrl+a</strong> to select the entire content of a single metadata or the <strong>tab</strong> key to navigate from a table cell to the next one was not implemented yet. Inserting elements could face some issues that did not allowed testers to insert tables, figure or formula (inline or block) inside the document, at the specified position. Moreover another important lack was the editing of bibliographic references, it was intended as raw text. Some testers are accustomed to use pre-arranged libraries as BibTeX because it styles the whole reference.</span></p>
        <p><span class="cgen" data-rash-original-content=" ">Instead <strong>interface category</strong> is mainly positive. The interface itself is pretty intuitive and minimal, toolbar icons and its familiarity with the most important wordprocessors made it user-friendly and easy to understand. The integration with Github is important to grant collaboration beetwen authors was positive in some case, but negative in other (in some cases bugs stopped the module which handled the integration with Github).</span></p>
        <p><span class="cgen" data-rash-original-content=" ">At last, <em>the tool was categorised as efficient</em> because it allowed testers to write less - or none - code lines (at difference from LaTeX, or any other markup language) and pursuit this writing task in less time than other ways to reproduce it.</span></p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>In this paper we talked about how the Semantic Web community and few publishers, are starting to talk about HTML submissions. It is thought as solution for the problems of the PDF format described above. The advantages that HTML bring with him are the easiness to be understood by machines and the interactiveness granted by browsers. PDF files and HTML documents are easily created with visual editors and word processors. Most of them are WYSIWYG, that allow authors to editate directly the output.</p>
      <p>HTML wraps a huge amount of elements which can have ambiguity. Two elements can be different, but visualised as same. RASH fix this problem. It is a subset of 32 HTML elements, which grants that every element is univocal. Another streght of RASH is its framework. Validation, visualization and conversion are all actions that RASH framework can do. But it needs a tool to semplify the creation of a RASH file, hiding all the technical facts about the markup structure. RAJE will be placed inside the RASH framework, in order to cover this need. RAJE is a HTML-based WYSIWYG editor, with generates RASH well-formed documents.We described the most popular and used HTML-based editors and word processors, the functionalities and development process in order to create RAJE, with JavaScript libraries, CSS styles and HTML files, and deploy the software packages.</p>
      <section id="section24">
        <h1>Future development</h1>
        <p> In addition of fixing bugs/issues , some new features are needed to be added. The most interesting feature are the annotations, that will be integrated using <a href="https://hypothes.is/">hypothes.is</a>. We also noticed the necessity of a table of content, to navigate in a better way long documents, to expand RAJE to allow chairs to create conferences and manage peer reviewing directly with RAJE, or its hypotetical web site. These are just few way in how we can next expand RAJE.<br /></p>
