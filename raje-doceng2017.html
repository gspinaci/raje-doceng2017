      <h1>Abstract</h1>
      <p>~200 words</p>
      <p>The most used format for submitting and publishing papers in the academic domain is Portable Document Format (PDF), since its possibility of being rendered in the same way independently from the device used for visualising it. However, the PDF format has some important issues as well: it lacks of interactivity, it is not machine-readable, it has seen as a monolithic artefact in the Web, and it is not offering an acceptable accessibility to people with disabilities. In order to address these issues, recently some journals, conferences, and workshops have started to accept also HTML as Web-first submission/publication format. However, most of the people are not able to produce a well-formed HTML5 article from scratch, and they would, thus, need an appropriate interface, e.g. a wordprocessor, for creating such HTML-compliant scholarly article. </p>
      <p> So as to provide a solution to the aforementioned issue, in this paper we introduce the RASH Javascript Editor (a.k.a. RAJE), which is a multiplatform wordprocessor for writing scholarly article in HTML natively. In particular it generates documents compliant with the RASH format, that is a subset of HTML5 developed for sharing scholarly articles with appropriate Web technologies. In particular, RAJE allows authors to write research papers by means of a user-friendly interface hiding the complexities of HTML5. We also discuss the outcomes of an user study where we ask several people from the Academia to write a scientific paper using RAJE.<br /></p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>~850 words</p>
      <p>Notes: describe first the environment, then my apport.</p>

      <h1>Related works</h1>
      <p>RAJE is a HTML-based wordprocessor, for this reason In the following section we discuss and list all the most important contributors of this area. These descriptions are not heavily detailed, the noted aspects are a simple description and the features of each editor. Every others massively-used wordprocessors are omitted in order to focus the attention only on HTML-based ones.</p>
      <p><strong>Authorea</strong> is an online platform to write and edit scientific papers. Every article is a page, for this reason every paper is a HTML document, plus a paper is a git repository. The first main focus was to <em>fix collaborative problems that could came out during the creation of technical, scholarly and scientific writings</em>, now authors can take advantages of using git versioning system, to keep track of every single displayed change. In fact everyone, which has the right persmissions, can undo specific commit and revert to its previous version. Every article in accessible anywhere, from any device connected to the Internet, and any TeX installations are not required. About tables and formulas it's very advanced. Authorea lets anyone write mathematical notations, tables, plots and fgures in each <em>LaTeX</em> and <em>MathML</em>.</p>
      <p>​​<strong>Dokieli</strong> is a client side editor for decentralised article publishing, annotations and social interactions. Is strongly based on decentralization, authors can publish wherever they want to. Authors can edit any HTML files just importing Dokieli CSS and JavaScripts. In this case Dokieli is not a real WYSIWYG word processor, but instead is more a special module that can turn a browser-rendered paper into a in-browser editable, and annotateable, HTML document.</p>
      <p>Dokieli allows authenticated authors to create in-text annotations and, of course, reply to them with the W3C web annotation specifications. It also implements Linked Data Notifications for notifications about entire or part of articles. Now it grants notifications for annotations, replies, shares, reviews, citations/links, bookmarks and likes. A big Dokieli's strenght is its full compatibility with HTML5. All HTML5 elements can be attached and inserted with it, and now some new UI features to do that are under development. For that reason the entire view style can be customized with just some CSS lines, or if needed style can be changed directly with Dokieli (e.g. passing fromnative visualization to Springer LNCS view).</p>
      <p><strong>Fidus Writer</strong> is an open source WYSIWYG collaborative HTML-based word processor made for academics who need to use citations and formulas within papers. All articles can be exported in more ways: website, paper or ebook. In each case the focus is the content, layouts can be choose during publication. FidusWriter supports LaTeX for adding footnotes and citations directly inside the documents. It is also collaborative in real-time, which means that FidusWriter aims to fix sharing problems for many-authors papers, and everyone can automatically see and write the document in the same time.Its formula system works hand by hand with MathJax, MathType and LaTeX.</p>
      <p><strong>TinyMCE</strong> is more an Open Source library than a stand-alone editor. It can integrate a WYSIWYG HTML-based editor inside a website. Is a large project that involve 130 contributors with almost 5000 commits on Github. Among its features there are formatting, table insertion, image editing, customizable themes and it is accesible for users with disabilities because it follows WAI-ARIA specification making it compatible with screen readers such as JAWS and NVDA. <br /></p>
      <p>Another strenght is that TinyMCE can be integrated everywhere. Can be found from CDN and package managers (NPM, Bower,NuGet), and integrated with frameworks such as JQuery and Angular.js, or inside common CMS like Wordpress or Joomla. Its community and contributors ar lively on networks, issues and enhancements are fastly fixed.<br /></p>
