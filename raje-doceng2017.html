      <h1>Abstract</h1>
      <p>~200 words</p>
      <p>The most used format for submitting and publishing papers in the academic domain is Portable Document Format (PDF), since its possibility of being rendered in the same way independently from the device used for visualising it. However, the PDF format has some important issues as well: it lacks of interactivity, it is not machine-readable, it has seen as a monolithic artefact in the Web, and it is not offering an acceptable accessibility to people with disabilities. In order to address these issues, recently some journals, conferences, and workshops have started to accept also HTML as Web-first submission/publication format. However, most of the people are not able to produce a well-formed HTML5 article from scratch, and they would, thus, need an appropriate interface, e.g. a wordprocessor, for creating such HTML-compliant scholarly article. </p>
      <p> So as to provide a solution to the aforementioned issue, in this paper we introduce the RASH Javascript Editor (a.k.a. RAJE), which is a multiplatform wordprocessor for writing scholarly article in HTML natively. In particular it generates documents compliant with the RASH format, that is a subset of HTML5 developed for sharing scholarly articles with appropriate Web technologies. In particular, RAJE allows authors to write research papers by means of a user-friendly interface hiding the complexities of HTML5. We also discuss the outcomes of an user study where we ask several people from the Academia to write a scientific paper using RAJE.<br /></p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>In this thesis I describe RAJE (acronym for RAsh Javascript Editor), a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor, for writing scholarly article in HTML. In particular it generates in output a subset of HTML elements called RASH (Research Articles in Sempli ed HTML). RAJE allows authors to write research papers by means of a user-friendly interface, instead of writing raw markup with a IDE or text editors. In addition it guarantees users the bene ts of a word processor combined with the ones given by a HTML-based format which are interactiveness, usability and easiness to be processed by calculators.
Currently the most used format in publications is PDF, which has strenghts that make it the De Facto standard in document sharing. Among them we cannd the hard formatting style, to ensure that every device is able to vi- sualise thele in the way it was created, as is. But PDF has also important problems, which are: the lack of interactivity, its ineptitude of to be shared via web, and the complicated readability by screen readers, to help authors with disabilities.
In order to create a PDFle, users need to create a document that will be exported as PDF after. These documents are written with an editor or word processor. Microsoft Word and OpenO ce are the most popular word processors. They produce DOC(X) and ODTles, and authors are allowed to export the document in PDF. Another way is using LaTeX i.e. a typesetting format that can be compiled to create the corrispondant PDFle. This method is di erent because users have to use a markup editor instead of a word-processor (there are also WYSIWYG LaTeX editors).
Recently, expecially inside Semantic Web community, reasearchers started to talk about HTML publication. Publication modes have not changed ev- erywhere, they still accept PDF, but few entities such as PeerJ, EKAW and Springer now accept also HTML articles. The biggest part of HTML arti- cles shared now are generated with online editors. Among them we cannd
Authorea, Fidus Writer, Dokieli and TinyMCE, that are the most popular. RAJE is placed inside the last group, with the di erence that it is de- veloped on a format i.e. RASH, and all its framework can comes in aid for handling conversions. Having only a univocal subset of HTML can help a lot with problems such as an unimplemented structural restriction, where same result can be reached with di erent structures (e.g. <strong>lorem</strong> element is different of lorem, but they are displayed equal). RAJE will be placed inside the RASH framework. It will come in aid of those authors which do not use other editors but need a tool that help write RASH with an interface, not as raw markup, especially for long documents. The whole project is created using web technologies as
HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which is the RAJE’s beating heart.
This thesis is written using RAJE itself. A Task Driven Test was orga-nized with 3 researchers of the deparment of computer science and engineer- ing at Bologna University. This test aims to discover the RAJE usability and inprove test question to do the same a wider population next. The results show di culties on: editing metadata,nd the button to add refer- ences (such as reference to images, tables and formulas, bibliographic links and footnotes). The feedbacks given by testers show also that some interface settings are better to be moved in other places, because they are a bit hard tond. The ”add a footnote” reference must be moved in a single button in the editor’s toolbar. In addition testers have found very useful the mathemati- cal formula editor, maybe with a link to its syntax. All issues are currently
underx.
The rest of the thesis is organised as follows. In Section 1 i describe the
ii
speci c context where RAJE operates, and it is useful to grant an outline of how publications work, pros and cons about PDF and EPUB and descrip- tion of the most popular format and HTML editors. In Section 2 I give few high-level information about what RAJE allows author to do, how interface is arranged and its strenghts such as Github integration and the formulas editor. In are wrapped all the low-level descriptions of RAJE. About the technologies and external libraries to develop it, and how I have deployed the whole software for MacOSX, Windows and Linux. In I describe the evalua- tion process: the population background, tasks implementation, development of results and conclusion.<br /></p>
